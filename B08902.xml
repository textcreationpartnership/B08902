            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur condition is ſtill very deplorable, but I know you are not ignorant of our many diſtractions and troubles, therefore I will not trouble you with any large relation, our perplexities &amp; fears are many, which makes us doubt what the ſucceſs of things may be &amp; ſomthing amazes us for the preſent, but the hopes of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes from <hi>England,</hi> quickens and revives our ſtartling ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſo that now we dayly expect the proviſions from <hi>England,</hi> which we here the Parliament hath ordered for our reliefe, and which by the bleſſing and aſſiſtance of the Almighty, we hope to receive in convenient time.</p>
            <p>The traiterous deedes of the Lord <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> did greatly ſtartle us, and all the Proteſtant party in <hi>Jreland,</hi> ſo that they were in a muſe, and much diſcomforted for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but the ſupplyes from <hi>England</hi> being timely ſent, will do very much good, and greatly incourage the Proteſtant Army. Col. <hi>Jones</hi> and Col. <hi>Munkes;</hi> with the reſt of the Proteſtant Commanders, are very diligent, and uſe their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:187863:4"/>utmoſt indeavours to incourage their Souldiers, defend themſelves, and offend their enemies, and if by any means, with the conjunction of their forces, they can make any thing a conſiderable party, they intend to give the Rebels battell, to hinder the uniting of their forces, who are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, as it is thought, againſt them, by which meanes they ſhall be the better able to helpe furniſh themſelves with ſuch neceſſaries, as otherwiſe they would extreamly want.</p>
            <p>Vice Admirall <hi>Crowther</hi> is very dilligent, and faithfull in his ſervice, and with great care attends the Ports of <hi>Corke</hi> and <hi>Kingſate,</hi> and other the Havens thereabouts, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a weary eye over all ſuſpitious perſons, and ſo very watchfull, that nothing be carried out of this Kingdome for the ſervice of Malignants, or any in Armes againſt the Proteſtant party, and not any ſupplyes be brought into the Kingdom for the reliefe or aſſiſtance of the Papiſts, and blood thirſty barbarous Rebels here.</p>
            <p>The Iriſh Rebels have promiſed and aſſured the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> to be true and faithfull unto him, and that they will to the utmoſt of their power aſſiſt him with their lives and eſtates, and for the aſſurance of this performance, they have entered into a Covenant with him, and for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Teſtimony that they which make good their proffers, and performe their Covenant: The Rebels have delivered up into <hi>Inchiquins</hi> hands, many holds and places of ſtrength, as <hi>Galloway, Linerick,</hi> and others, which they ſay he ſh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>SEverall Acts which paſſed in the Parl. there, ſome are very deſirous to have an Army raiſed here, and ſome preparations are making for that purpoſe, and many Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers liſting; but I knew none of quality in command as yet.</p>

            <p>The Parl. of <hi>Scotland</hi> are upon a Declaration, wherein are the reaſons which they ſay is the cauſe why they put the Kingdom into a poſture of defence, which endeavours to ſatisfie the Kingdom; for ſo doing, this Declaration is already committed to ſeveral bodies of the ſtates, and will be ſpeedily publiſhed.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Ireland</hi> came a Meſſenger to the Parl. of <hi>Scotland</hi> from the Iriſh forces, and brought a proffer of their ſervice, and gave in aſſurance that they would joyne with them, with the Meſſenger the Sco<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
